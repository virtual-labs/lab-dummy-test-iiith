The role of this Virtual Labs is to complement the lectures and reading material and the programming lab in three ways : 1. Present visual animations of data structures 2. Allow students to interactively execute algorithms in these data structures. 3. Allow students to interactively compute the cost of using these data structures with different algorithms.",
